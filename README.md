# PyBer_Analysis

* Collect and analyze ride share data from three target markets:
* Urban
* Suburban
* Rural


# Data Used for Analysis of Markets
    * Total Drivers
    * Total Fares
    * Average Fare per Ride
    * Average Fare per Driver
    * Total Fare by City Type
    * Total Rides
    
    
    
    
    
### Reviewing the data for total rides we can see
   * The total number of urban rides is greater than the total for suburban rides
   * The total number of urban rides is roughly 13 times the number of rural rides
   * Extra effort could be made in these markets to drive sales the metric could be improved



   
   ##### Recommendations

* Discount "Happy Hours"
* Senior discounts
* Student fare reductions








###  Greater number of drivers will cause the fare to decrease 



  #### Recommendations
  
* Offer "value based" services 
* Increase rates during high volume times
* Provide high end transportation options
